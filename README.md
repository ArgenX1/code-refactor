Homework 1 due 9-17-21

This assignment helped me understand how to consolidate the CSS and fix minor bugs

When I first started on it I had no idea what I was doing but over a few days I really started to grasp the concepts

This project also helped me learn how to use the GitHub repositories the right way,
also how to push my changes to GitHub.
